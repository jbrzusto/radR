quick adaptation of radR to read video and process it

here's what's needed:

- plugin to read frames of a video using ffmpeg; set frame rate

  here's how to grab a frame from an arbitrary time offset in a .wmv file using ffmpeg and
  output to standard output (replace the final "-" with a filename to dump it there instead)

     ffmpeg -ss 47.67   -flags gray -i Flying_birds_2.wmv  -vframes 1  -f image2   -vcodec png    -
key:        time offset  grayscale      input file         num frames  output type  output format output destination

  here's how to get the duration of a video:

  as.difftime(strsplit(grep("Duration", readLines(pipe("ffmpeg  -i /home/john/video/Flying_birds_2.wmv  -vframes 0 2>&1")), value=TRUE), ",")[[1]][1], format="  Duration: %H:%M:%OS")


- ability for plugin to specify data coordinate mapping

- option in sample classification to allow for classifying "too cold" samples
  as hot.  needed for grayscale video because targets can be lighter *or* darker
  than background; is best way to do this to re-purpose the cold threshold
  so that samples colder than the cold threshold are treated as hot?  Or do
  we want more than one class from which patches can be obtained?

- scan converter: new option to map data from rectangular rather than polar data
