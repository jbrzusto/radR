GIFSICLE 1.52 (patched)
=============

NOTE: this is a patched version of Gifsicle 1.52.  It adds the ability
to capture a full-color window into a GIF, using a 6-8-5 (R-G-B)
palette with 16 additional intermediate grayscale values.  The window
is specified by giving a hexadecimal ID (beginning with "0x") as a
filename, with 0x0 representing the root or Desktop window.

e.g.

    gifsicle 0x00A1e300 > mywin.gif
    gifsicle 0x0 > desktop.gif

The patch is by John Brzustowski jbrzusto AT fastmail DOT fm. 

ABOUT GIFSICLE
--------------
   Gifsicle twaddles GIF image files in a variety of ways. It is better
than many of the freely available GIF twaddlers on the market -- for one
thing, it has more options.

   It supports merging several GIFs into a GIF animation; exploding an
animation into its component frames; changing individual frames in an
animation; turning interlacing on and off; adding transparency; adding
delays, disposals, and looping to animations; adding or removing comments;
flipping and rotation; optimizing animations for space; and changing
images' colormaps, among other things. Extensive command-line options
control which, if any, of these occur.

   Gifview, a companion program requiring X11, displays GIF images and
animations on an X display. It can display multi-frame GIFs either as
slideshows, displaying one frame at a time, or as real-time animations.

   Gifdiff, another companion program, checks two GIF files for identical
visual appearance. This is probably most useful for testing
GIF-manipulating software.

   Each of these programs has a manpage, 'PROGRAMNAME.1'.

   The Gifsicle package comes with NO WARRANTY, express or implied,
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose.

MAKING GIFSICLE ON UNIX
-----------------------
   You need an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc.

   Just type './configure', then 'make'.  'make install' will build and
install gifsicle and its manual page (under /usr/local by default).

   './configure' accepts the usual options. See 'INSTALL' for more
details.

   To build without gifview (for example, if you don't have X11), give the
'--disable-gifview' option. To build without gifdiff, give the
'--disable-gifdiff' option. To have Gifsicle create unGIFs instead of GIFs,
give the '--enable-ungif' option.

MAKING GIFSICLE ON 32-BIT WINDOWS
---------------------------------
   Emil Mikulic <darkmoon@connexus.net.au> has provided a Makefile for
building gifsicle out of the box on 32-bit Windows. It has since been
updated by Eddie Kohler and Steven Marthouse <comments@vrml3d.com>. Just
unpack the distribution, change into its "src" directory, and type

	nmake -f Makefile.w32

Gifview will not be built. 

   Stephen Schnipsel <schnipsel@m4f.net> provided an altered Makefile for
building gifsicle on Windows using Borland C++. Unpack the distribution,
change into its "src" directory, and type

	nmake -f Makefile.bcc

   You will need to edit one of these Makefiles if you are building
ungifsicle, or if you are compiling with a different compiler. You can edit
it with any text editor (like Notepad). See the file for more information.

THE GIF PATENTS AND UNGIFS
--------------------------
   Unisys formerly held patents on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression
algorithm used in GIFs, which means that GIF-manipulating software could
not be truly free.  As of October 1, 2006, however, it is believed (by the
Software Freedom Law Center and the Free Software Foundation, among others)
that there are no significant patent claims interfering with employment of
the GIF format.  For that reason, gifsicle is completely free software.

   Nonetheless, Gifsicle can be configured to write run-length-encoded
GIFs, rather than LZW-compressed GIFs, avoiding these obsolete patents.
This idea was first implemented independently by Toshio Kuratomi
<badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu> and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation
(http://www.hasc.com/, <info@hasc.com>). Turn this on by giving
'./configure' the '--enable-ungif' switch. Now that the patents have
expired there is no good reason to turn on this switch, which inflates GIF
sizes often by a factor of 2 or more. If your copy of gifsicle says
'(ungif)' when you run 'gifsicle --version', it is writing
run-length-encoded GIFs.
