Notes on the archive files recorded by RTI software

- each file represents a single sweep (aka "scan" in radR usage)

- each data segment within a file might or might not be compressed -
  the flag in its header must be checked

- this plugin attempts to deal correctly with sweeps where the sample
  clock changes, by using the coarsest clock found, and resampling
  pulses to match it (i.e. use the largest maximum range in the sweep)
  A change in sample clock triggers a restart of learning, if radR is finding
  blips.

- sensor segments contain the full block of data, but the flag header
  indicates which items are actually valid

- sweep duration calculations should be very precise for files of
  version >= REC_TYPE_RLC_4, except when the sample clock changes

- for files recorded with an XIR3000, mapping from range index and
  sample rate to sample_clock is:

  sample_clock = sample_rate / 2^(range_index)
  (for files recorded by the XIR3000)

- for files recorded by the old RIB hardware, the sample_clock depends
  on the DSP version (7 or 9) as well as the range_index, and the DSP
  version is not recorded in the file, so the user must guess which
  applies to a particular archive.

  sample_clock = if (DSP_VERSION == 7) 324.40 MHz / 2^(range_index)
  	         else if (DSP_VERSION == 9) 108.13 MHz / 2^(range_index)

  If the sample_clock rate is higher than the fundamental A/D
  conversion clock rate of 54MHz, this presumably implies that sample
  values are duplicated in adjacent slots.
