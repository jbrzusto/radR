TODO

- function to return a compressed history for a time window:
  this is a minimal set of (time, state) pairs for which 
  the error in linear approximation of state throughout the window
  is at most some specified amount. e.g. tell me everything I need
  to know to estimate the angle for each pulse in a scan with
  an error of at most 0.1 degrees.  For a time window with no
  change in state, this is a single number.  For other cases,
  there will be 2n numbers: n pairs of (time, state).

- make a template class for a minderserver

- make it convenient to have the server listen to all (not just
   loopback) network interfaces
