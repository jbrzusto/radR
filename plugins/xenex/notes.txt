Notes on using RTI SDK 1.5.0.008 with an XIR3000B USB video processor and radR.

SDK vs. software delivered with XIR3000B
- Make sure radR will be using the files from the SDK version with which radR was built;
  this will typically require copying files from the SDK/Release directory to overwrite the files in 
  c:/Program Files/RTI/Horizon NT/ which came with the XIR board.

RadarSample
- in the status line generated by INT_VP_GetDiagText (visible in the USB VP Extended Control window), 
  the values of "BPperSweep" and "Ave:" are identical; they both represent the average time of all sweeps
  up to the current one.  Presumably, the former is supposed to be the value for the most recent sweep
  only.

CANSTAR.H
- there are two typos:  "bool" instead of "BOOL", and a default value (" = NULL") left in a parameter declaration.
  (see the diff)

Furuno parameters:

trigger: down, gain=7, low=52, high=85
azi: down gain=11 low=38 high=187
shm: down gain=7 low=21 high=94
