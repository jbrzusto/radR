Title: A Wrapper Class for Environments to Provide Strict Symbol Lookup
        and Binding Semantics
Version: 1.0

Description: This simple class enforces explicit creation of new
        symbols in an environment.  Attempting to get or set the value
        of a non-existent symbol generates an error rather than the
        default R behaviour.  Operators are provided for explictly
        creating and binding new symbols.  Symbols are matched exactly
        (i.e. no partial matching). Using a strictenv in place of an
        environment may ease debugging.
