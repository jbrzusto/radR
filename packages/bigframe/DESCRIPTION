Description: Creates file-backed data.frame like objects.  Data are inserted/extracted/deleted using indexing and indexed assignment.  Allowed column types are logical, integer, real, complex, and character.  Character columns are given maximum string lengths (from 4 to 512) at creation time.  Assigning to non-contiguous parts of the frame fills intervening rows with NA values, extending the file.  Deleting rows from the end of a bigframe truncates the associated file.
