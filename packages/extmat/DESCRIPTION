Description: For large matrices with elements of fixed size that you
        don't want R to copy.  Access to data is via subclassed
        indexing.  Integer and floating point types beyond those native
        to R, as well as arbitrary fixed size "user" types are allowed.
        Extmats created by R code use the R memory manager.
