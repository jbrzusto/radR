Description: Creates file-backed lists of arbitrary R objects, indexed by integers.  Elements can be assigned in any order without space/time penalties.  This package is intended for keeping persistent lists of items that are rarely changed after being created.  WARNING:  changing or deleting biglist items after they are created leaves holes in the disk file.
